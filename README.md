<h1>The process of learning a new language Goland(GO)</h1>

**22.07.2022**

<p>On the first day of training, I read the official documentation and with the help of a free course I did:</p>


- Learned how to include libraries in the project.
- Studied functions for tracking user actions.
- I was able to create my first web-page in this language, and of course I saw a great inscription **"Hello world"**.
