<p>On the first day of training, I read the official documentation and with the help of a free course I did:</p>

- Learned how to include libraries in the project.
- Studied functions for tracking user actions.
- I was able to create my first web-page in this language, and of course I saw a great inscription **"Hello world"**.

<p>in the second lesson, I learned how to create constructions and call information from them on the page, I did:</p>

- creating structure with <code>type User struct</code>
- made a function for pulling information using <code>getAllInfo()</code>
- created a function that changes the key name in the structure using <code>setNewName</code>
