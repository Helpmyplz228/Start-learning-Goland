<h1>The process of learning a new language Goland(GO)</h1>

**18.07.2022 - 22.07.2022**

<p>On the first day of training, I read the official documentation and with the help of a free course I did:</p>

- Learned how to include libraries in the project.
- Studied functions for tracking user actions.
- I was able to create my first web-page in this language, and of course I saw a great inscription **"Hello world"**.

<p>in the second lesson, I learned how to create constructions and call information from them on the page, I did:</p>

- creating structure with <code>type User struct</code>
- made a function for pulling information using <code>getAllInfo()</code>
- created a function that changes the key name in the structure using <code>setNewName</code>

<p>this evening I finished studying the basic part of the training, there was a lot of information, so I decided to stop, it seems to me that if I go further, I can forget some of the basics and have in my toolkit only those that I will study in the next lesson. To solve this problem, the next day I will take a quick look at all the code that I wrote today, read it, revise the lessons again at a speed of 1.5 and write down everything that I could not remember in a notebook</p>
